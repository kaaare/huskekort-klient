event handler:  window.onhashchange
Cuddle name:    Router

There is no map maintained between hash/fragment urls and toplevel components, this map is derived each time the handler is triggered, from inspecting the DOM and listing all elements that has a class name "toplevel" in them.

object:         componentVisibilityObserver
cuddle name:    Visibility detector
responsibility: Populate components with values when the component is rendered visible. This is done by querying the DOM for elements having the class name "model", and using the id of that element as the name of the components property to populate the html elements textContent with.
methods:        only the standard methods provided by the InteractionObserver API
